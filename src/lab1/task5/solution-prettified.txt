CONGRATULATIONS
THIS
WASNT
QUITE
AN
EASY
TASK
AND
ONLY
A
COUPLE
OF
LAST
YEAR
STUDENTS
GOT
TO
THIS
POINT
NOW
ALL
THIS
TEXT
IS
JUST
GARBAGE
TO
LET
YOU
USE
SOME
FREQUENCY
ANALYSIS
WE
SET
SAIL
ON
THIS
NEW
SEA
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NEW
KNOWLEDGE
TO
BE
GAINED
AND
NEW
RIGHTS
TO
BE
WON
AND
THEY
JUST
BE
WON
AND
USED
FOR
THE
PROGRESS
OF
ALL
PEOPLE
FOR
SPACE
SCIENCE
LIKE
NUCLEAR
SCIENCE
AND
ALL
TECHNOLOGY
HAS
NO
CONSCIENCE
OF
ITS
OWN
WHETHER
IT
WILL
BECOME
A
FORCE
FOR
GOOD
OR
ILL
DEPENDS
ON
MAN
AND
ONLY
IF
THE
UNITED
STATES
OCCUPIES
A
POSITION
OF
PRE
EMINENCE
CAN
WE
HELP
DECIDE
WHETHER
THIS
NEW
OCEAN
WILL
BE
A
SEA
OF
PEACE
OR
A
NEW
TERRIFYING
THEATER
OF
WAR
I
DO
NOT
SAY
THE
WE
SHOULD
OR
WILL
GO
UNPROTECTED
AGAINST
THE
HOSTILE
MISUSE
OF
SPACE
ANY
MORE
THAN
WE
GO
UNPROTECTED
AGAINST
THE
HOSTILE
USE
OF
LAND
OR
SEA
BUT
I
DO
SAY
THAT
SPACE
CAN
BE
EXPLORED
AND
MASTERED
WITHOUT
FEEDING
THE
FIRES
OF
WAR
WITHOUT
REPEATING
THE
MISTAKES
THAT
MAN
HAS
MADE
IN
EXTENDING
HIS
WRIT
AROUND
THIS
GLOBE
OF
OURS
WE
CHOOSE
TO
GO
TO
THE
MOON
IN
THIS
DECADE
AND
DO
THE
OTHER
THINGS
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
EASY
BUT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
HARD
BECAUSE
THAT
GOAL
WILL
SERVE
TO
ORGANIZE
AND
MEASURE
THE
BEST
OF
OUR
ENERGIES
AND
SKILLS
BECAUSE
THAT
CHALLENGE
IS
ONE
THAT
WE
ARE
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
ONE
WE
ARE
UNWILLING
TO
POSTPONE
AND
ONE
WHICH
WE
INTEND
TO
WIN
AND
THE
OTHERS
TOO
OK
AND
NOW
THE
REAL
DEAL
