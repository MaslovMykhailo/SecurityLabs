1.  Linear congruential generator. {Mode} in link is “Lcg”. Numbers are generated like this:
public int Next()
{
	_last = (a * _last + c) % m; // m is 2^32
	return (int) _last;
}
The first one who writes “a” and “c” values to group chat will get +1 scores.
Lesson to learn: just never use LCG for anything.
